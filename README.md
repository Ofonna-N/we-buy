## Project Focus

While the UI of this project may not be the most visually polished, it serves as a deliberate choice to prioritize the development aspects. The primary goal of 'we-buy' was to demonstrate strong full-stack development skills, including efficient data handling, user authentication, payment integration, and robust back-end functionality. The emphasis here is on functionality, security, and overall application performance, rather than aesthetics.

I believe that a strong foundation in development is key, and this project represents my dedication to mastering the technical aspects of building a real-world e-commerce application. It provides a solid base upon which visual improvements and refinements can be made in future iterations.
